# Genie

Initially planned to be a complete refactor and redesign of
MayDaniel/clj-microblog, it's now going to be a blog.

Genie works, but lacks all visual design. I have enough to be able to
write more Clojure, and I'll (attempt to) prettify it with Javascript
and CSS after.

## Usage

MongoDB is required, but it's simple to [set up](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart).

Start MongoDB.
